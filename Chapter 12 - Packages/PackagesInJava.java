// Packages in Java: A package is used to group related classes in Java. Packages help in avoiding name conflicts.

// There are two types of packages.
// 1) Built-In Package. -> API
// 2) User Defined Package. -> Custom Package Created by programmer.

// Note: We can check all the inbuilt packages of Java using the steps given here. 
// Local Disk (C) -> Programming Files -> Java -> jdk -> lib -> src.zip. This src.zip file contains all the inbuilt packages of java use can check it by unzipping the file with the help of WinRAR.

// In src.zip file you can go to java.base and you can see all the inbuilt packages of Java there.
